# fitness-tracker

A web app that is designed to track your workouts

## Description

Fitness tracker is a web application that uses chart.js and mongoose to track your workouts and exercises within those workouts. You can add cardio and resistance exercises and track all of your recent work outs with a handy graph page.

## Installation and Usage

There is no need for any installation, and to use, just add exercises by "continuing" your workouts, and to add new workouts, just click the add workout button.

## Credits

The front end of this website was provided to me by UCSD Extension, and I designed the database and server routes for the backend of the application.
I also received a little help with closing off and optimizing some of the routes from Jun Park and Vivianna Cowin, two MongoDB experts.
